<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We may collect and process the following information about you:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">&bull; the App is a personalised transport assistant and for it to operate effectively it needs to track and store your location, movement and transport use (see 'Your location data' below);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">&bull; your preferences, (such as Saved items but only when you choose to provide us with these) which helps us provide you with more tailored services;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">&bull; communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns or comments regarding the App or its content;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">&bull; information from surveys that we may, from time to time, run on the App for research purposes, if you choose to respond to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We may offer users the ability to register their own personal account with us, so that their preferences and travel data can be accessed from different devices and where an existing device is lost or stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where you open an account, data collected in relation to you and your use of the App will be linked on our systems with that account.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We work hard to improve the App and add functionality which we think will make it more fun and more useful for our users.&nbsp; New functionality may involve similar or incidental uses of your data to those set out above.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We also, without you having to do anything, will collect the following information:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">&bull; details of your visits to the App, the searches you make, the resources you access and any data you download; this may also be tracked and analysed by third parties providing us with analytics services which help us understand how users use the App so we can improve it;</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Uses made of your information</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We will use the information we collect to:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">&bull; administer your account with us;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">&bull; identify issues with the operation of the App, and provide crash reports in order to find a resolution for performance issues;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">&bull; improve the design, functionality and/or content of the pages of the App and customise them for users;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">&bull; carry out research on our users' transport choices;</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Your location data</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We are a personalised transport App, and to provide our service we need to process your location. If enabled, this happens each time you open up the App, and if you select the “Save/Track” journey feature. The types of location data that we collect and store are your latitude, longitude, time of travel and compass related data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">You can also choose not to allow us to process your location data at the time you connect to the App, or any time after that either by changing the settings on your mobile device. Please note that if you choose not to allow us to process your location data, we will not be able to provide you with the full benefit of the App.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Security</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it. You should bear in mind that the submission of information over the internet and mobile networks is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the App whilst it is in transit over the internet or mobile networks and any such submission is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Storage of your information</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">Information that you submit via the App is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United Kingdom, other European Economic Area countries and in the United States. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above, which may be situated outside the European Economic Area (for instance in the United States) and may be processed by staff operating outside the European Economic Area. By submitting information via the App, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Your rights</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">If you are accessing the App from the European Economic Area, you have a legal right under the Data Protection Act 1998 to a copy of all the personal information about you held by us. On request, we will provide you with a copy of this information subject to a fee not exceeding £10. You also have a right to correct any errors in that information. As mentioned above, you have a right to prevent the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">If you are accessing the App from the US and wish to keep your personal information accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as specified below. We will take reasonable steps to update or correct personal information in our possession that you have previously submitted via the App. If you no longer want to receive marketing messages from us, please let us know by writing to us at the email address specified below, and you will be unsubscribed accordingly. Please note that sometimes it can take a short amount of time to refresh our records for these purposes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Additional information</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">When you visit the App, we may automatically collect additional information about you, such as the type of phone or operating system you use and, if you came to the website, the type of internet browser you use and the website from which you have come to the site. Also, depending on whether you access the App on your personal computer or via your mobile device, we will collect your IP address (the unique address which identifies your home computer on the internet) or the installation of the App on your smartphone which are automatically recognised by our servers. You cannot be identified solely from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on the App and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">The App uses cookies to store certain information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website or app transfers to your hard drive or mobile device to store and sometimes track information about you. Although they do identify a user's device, cookies do not personally identify users.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Information sharing</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We may disclose aggregate statistics about users of the App, and anonymised data on your location, movement and transport choices in order to selected third parties for research analysis product development and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We may disclose your personal information to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the services we offer through the App, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions, for instance, we offer a cycle route function from Cyclestreets, and they receive your journey details but no personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to the entity or entities running the app business (or relevant part of it) or third party buyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or cybercrime or to protect the App or enforce the terms under which you transact with us or enforce the rights, property or personal safety of any person.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Public forums</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">The App may, from time to time, make public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and never disclose your personal information.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">External links</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">The App may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Under 13 year olds</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through the App. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s internet use and to help enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information on our website without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, please contact us as specified below, and we will work to delete that information from our databases.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Notifications</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We may send you information we think you may find useful (e.g. tube line and subway disruptions) or which you have requested from us by push notification and/or by email (if provided), and we or the operating system will always give you the option to opt-out of receiving further notifications or emails.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Cookies Policy</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11.5pt">We do not use cookies.</span></p>
